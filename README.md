## Imagine a world where everyone was born:
     ###### Each in their own year
     ###### Each in their own month
     ###### Each on their own day
     ###### Each wondering what makes them unique

## The Problem we are Addressing:
     ###### How to feel special when there are 7.4 billion people on earth?
     ###### How to leverage the power of the internet 

## Is this Even Possible:
	###### Does the internet even have interesting information?
	###### Is there a programming interface for applications on the internet?
	###### Is there a coding language that can be used to access these hypothetical interfaces?
	###### Would this coding language then be able to take this information and give it to a person based on a couple simple inputs?

## Good News Everyone! (Insert Futurama Reference Here)
	###### APIs are libraries that are used to get information, and in our cases, interesting information!
	###### Javascript along with HTML and CSS can create a web app that makes this information accessible
	###### Using APIs, we are able to pull interesting information and personalize it to the user's birth information and deliever this to them in a fun way
	###### We are also able to use javascript and jquery to add some surprise elements if the users are celeberating their birthday on that day

## Our Process:
	###### Develop a successful workflow process that uses github as well as our time in and out of class
	###### Research APIs:
		*** Coordinate what is possible given the price point of available APIs as well as how they can be searched.
		*** For example, some APIs can only be searched by month, day, or year as opposed to simply YYYYMMDD format
	###### Research and implement new technologies:
		*** HTML Canvas
		*** JQuery Animation
		*** CSS Animations and Transformations

## Enjoy the app!
