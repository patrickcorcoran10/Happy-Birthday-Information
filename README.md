## Group Do: Designing your MVP

###### 1. Who is your target audience?
     *** Anyone that can access the website.

###### 2. What is the problem that the product will address?
     *** Will supplement informative/historical/educatioal/trivial information to the end user

###### 3. What is the primary goal of the product?
     *** Entertain, Inform, and Educate

###### 4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
     *** I want a personalized history lesson.
     *** I want to input very little data, but be provided with enteraining information
     *** I want to input very little data, but be provided with informative/educational information



## * Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

## As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

###### 1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
###### 2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
###### 3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives.

## Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
